# System Design  
System design is a step-by-step process of defining a particular software's architecture, modules, components, etc. It is a base concept in software engineering and is vital in building scalable and reliable software.  

System design is crucial for software development as it lays out the architecture of the application, ensuring scalability, high availability, and consistency. It involves understanding functional and non-functional requirements, choosing appropriate databases (SQL or NoSQL), and designing for scalability. For example, companies like Google and Facebook use multiple servers worldwide to optimize efficiency and performance  

### Main points
- Requirement Gathering: Understand functional and non-functional requirements.
- Architecture Planning: Design the system architecture based on requirements.
- Database Selection: Decide between SQL and NoSQL based on data needs.
- Scalability: Plan for increased traffic and efficient resource management.
- Real-world Examples: Companies like Google and Facebook use global servers to enhance performance.



## importance of system design
System design is important because it helps in:  
1. **Scalability**: A well-designed system can scale easily to meet the growing demands of users and data.
2. **Reliability**: A well-designed system is more reliable and less prone to failures.  
3. **Maintainability**: A well-designed system is easier to maintain and update.  
4. **Performance**: A well-designed system can handle high traffic and large amounts of data efficiently.  
5. **Cost-effectiveness**: A well-designed system can reduce costs by minimizing the need for hardware upgrades and reducing the risk of downtime.  

  ### Essential Design Methods in System Design  
  The system design contains a wide range of design methods and techniques to design the system's architecture. Developers are required to choose a particular method based on the project's requirements.

Here, I've covered some of the system design methods commonly used by developers.

1.**Architectural Design**

The architectural design is the base of the system design. It describes the infrastructure, model, view, components, and interaction.

The architectural design includes client-server interaction, microservices, etc.  

2.**ERD Diagram**  

The ERD diagram is an acronym for the entity-relationship diagram. The ERD diagram is mainly used in designing the application's database structure.

In the ERD diagram, you can define multiple database schemas, add entities in each schema, and add multiple attributes for each entity. Also, you can connect the entities of two different schemas if a relationship exists between them.  
  
3.**UML Diagram**  

The UML stands for the unified modeling language. It is used to prepare modeling software systems.

It contains different diagrams like activity diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc., to represent the different aspects of the system.  
  
4.**Class Diagrams**  

The class diagrams are used to represent the classes. The class diagram can also contain the class's attributes, methods, and relationships between multiple classes.

Basically, the class diagram provides an overview of the system's data and functionality.

5.**Sequence Diagrams**  

The sequence diagrams represent the interaction between the various components of the system. It is used to model the behavior of the system.

For example, you can specify when users enter the specific input at the front end side of the application, how the application should process the data, and return the response.
