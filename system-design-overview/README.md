# System Design  
System design is a step-by-step process of defining a particular software's architecture, modules, components, etc. It is a base concept in software engineering and is vital in building scalable and reliable software.  

System design is crucial for software development as it lays out the architecture of the application, ensuring scalability, high availability, and consistency. It involves understanding functional and non-functional requirements, choosing appropriate databases (SQL or NoSQL), and designing for scalability. For example, companies like Google and Facebook use multiple servers worldwide to optimize efficiency and performance  

### Main points
- Requirement Gathering: Understand functional and non-functional requirements.
- Architecture Planning: Design the system architecture based on requirements.
- Database Selection: Decide between SQL and NoSQL based on data needs.
- Scalability: Plan for increased traffic and efficient resource management.
- Real-world Examples: Companies like Google and Facebook use global servers to enhance performance.



## importance of system design
System design is important because it helps in:  
1. **Scalability**: A well-designed system can scale easily to meet the growing demands of users and data.
2. **Reliability**: A well-designed system is more reliable and less prone to failures.  
3. **Maintainability**: A well-designed system is easier to maintain and update.  
4. **Performance**: A well-designed system can handle high traffic and large amounts of data efficiently.  
5. **Cost-effectiveness**: A well-designed system can reduce costs by minimizing the need for hardware upgrades and reducing the risk of downtime.  

  ### Essential Design Methods in System Design  
  The system design contains a wide range of design methods and techniques to design the system's architecture. Developers are required to choose a particular method based on the project's requirements.

Here, I've covered some of the system design methods commonly used by developers.

1.**Architectural Design**

The architectural design is the base of the system design. It describes the infrastructure, model, view, components, and interaction.

The architectural design includes client-server interaction, microservices, etc.  

2.**ERD Diagram**  

The ERD diagram is an acronym for the entity-relationship diagram. The ERD diagram is mainly used in designing the application's database structure.

In the ERD diagram, you can define multiple database schemas, add entities in each schema, and add multiple attributes for each entity. Also, you can connect the entities of two different schemas if a relationship exists between them.  
  
3.**UML Diagram**  

The UML stands for the unified modeling language. It is used to prepare modeling software systems.

It contains different diagrams like activity diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc., to represent the different aspects of the system.  
  
4.**Class Diagrams**  

The class diagrams are used to represent the classes. The class diagram can also contain the class's attributes, methods, and relationships between multiple classes.

Basically, the class diagram provides an overview of the system's data and functionality.

5.**Sequence Diagrams**  

The sequence diagrams represent the interaction between the various components of the system. It is used to model the behavior of the system.

For example, you can specify when users enter the specific input at the front end side of the application, how the application should process the data, and return the response.  

## system desing concepts:
1.**performance vs scalability:**
  
  - Performance: Faster load times improve user experience; techniques like caching enhance performance.  

  - Scalability: Ability to handle increased load by distributing across multiple servers or enhancing server capacity, crucial for popular applications like Google.
 
 2.**Consistency Patterns and Availability Patterns:**  
   
   - Consistency: Ensures all system nodes read the same data at the same time.
   - Availability: Ensures each request gets a response, critical for high uptime.  
     
## Advanced Concepts in System Design
 1. CDN (Content Delivery Network):

      - A distributed network of servers at different geo-locations.  

      - Delivers content like images and data faster, reduces latency, and improves application performance.  
      - Requests the nearest server for resources; if cached, it serves directly, otherwise, requests from the origin server, caches, and delivers to users.

  2. DNS (Domain Name System):  

     - Replaces the need to use IP addresses with domain names for accessing websites.  
     - Maps unique domain names to unique IP addresses.  
     - Facilitates easier access to websites by returning resources associated with the domain name's IP address.  
       
3. Caching:
    
    - A mechanism for faster resource delivery, acting as high-speed storage.  
    - Checks cache storage for data before requesting from the database.  
    - If data is not in cache, retrieves from the source, stores it in cache, and sends to the application.  
    - Browsers use cookies to cache data.  
4. Proxies:
 
    - Acts as an intermediary between the client application and the internet.

    - Requests resources from the internet on behalf of the client and sends them back.

    - Used for caching and altering proxy servers through VPNs to access blocked resources.
## Components of System Design

1. **Microservices and Service Discovery:**
   - Microservices Architecture: Breaks down complex applications into small, independent services that accomplish specific tasks.  

   -  Service Identification: Each microservice has a unique ID and name.  

   -  Dynamic Service Discovery: Microservices can dynamically find and interact with other services within the network, facilitating scaling and load balancing.  

2. **Database Systems: RDBMS and NoSQL:**

    - RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):
    - Stores data in table format.
    - Suitable for structured data.
    - Vertical scaling (cannot scale horizontally).
   -  Uses SQL for querying.
   - Accessing data is relatively slow.  

**NoSQL (Non-SQL Database):**
  - Stores data in various formats (key-value, document, graph, etc.).
  - Stores data in key-value pairs.  

   - Suitable for unstructured data.
   - Horizontally scalable (can add new key-value pairs).
   -  Each record can have different key-value pairs.
   - Faster access than RDBMS.
   - Supports frequent changes in the database.  


3.communication Protocols  

   Protocols mean rules and communication protocols refer to the rules to communicate or exchange the data between two systems. The systems can also be server and client.  
   various communication protocols include:  
    
  - **_HTTP/HTTPS:_** The full form of the HTTP is a hypertext transfer protocol. HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP. They are used in web-based communication. It is a good idea to use HTTPS always for security reasons.
  - **_TCP/IP:_** The TCP stands for the transmission control protocol. The TCP protocol is used to communicate over the internet. For example, it is used in the chatting application.
  - **_UDP_** – The UDP is an acronym for the user datagram protocol. It is mainly used for live streaming, video calls, etc., in which data loss can be tolerable.
  - WebSockets: The web sockets are used for bi-directional duplex communication. It builds the connection between two web applications.

# Approaching System Design Interview Questions

  1. **Clarify Requirements:** Ask questions to clarify the requirements of the system. What are
  the functional and non-functional requirements of the system? What are the constraints?
  2. **Define the Problem:** Define the problem you are trying to solve. What are the
  challenges you are facing? What are the goals of the system?
  3. **Identify the Key Components:** Identify the key components of the system. What are
  the main components of the system? What are their responsibilities?
  4. **Design the System:** Design the system based on the key components identified. How
  will the components interact with each other? What are the data flows between the
  components? What are the scalability and performance considerations?
  5. **Evaluate the Design:** Evaluate the design based on the requirements and constraints.
  What are the trade-offs of the design? What are the potential bottlenecks? How can
  the design be improved?
  6. **Optimize the Design:** Optimize the design based on the evaluation. How
  can the design be optimized for scalability, performance, and reliability? What are
  the potential improvements?
